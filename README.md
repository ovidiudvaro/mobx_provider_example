# personality_test_app
Build a simple personality test application.

Takes 3-5 different questions, maps them into a score and produces a personality trait of either Introvert or Extrovert.

You can find examples of questions here: https://www.psychologies.co.uk/self/are-you-an-introvert-or-an-extrovert.html.

An example could be: Landing screen Start personality test Dynamic screen, that reads question and answers from a the backend (Just mock the backend) Finish screen, where you can see your personality trait. It is a plus if you write some unit-tests.
